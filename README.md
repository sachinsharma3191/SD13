## Designing Uber backend

**What to be designed?**

Design should be able to allow users to book rides like a taxi based service.

**Feature Requirements**

There are two types of users in our system: 
1) Drivers 
2) Customers.

Primary features: 

1.	Drivers should be notified about their current location and their availability to pick up passengers.
2.	The passengers when selecting a ride should be able to see all the available drivers in a given radius.
3.	As and when the passengers make a request for the ride, the drivers within the radius must be notified about the request being made.
4.	Once the drive and passenger confirm on the ride details, they should be able to monitor the location about where they are heading until the passenger gets off.
5.	When the passenger reaches the destination, the driver should mark the journey complete and should make himself available for the next ride.

**TO DO : Follow the below framework to design System. Mandatory upload of hand drawn photos of design.**

**Capacity Estimation and Constraints**

**Fault Tolerance and Replication**
